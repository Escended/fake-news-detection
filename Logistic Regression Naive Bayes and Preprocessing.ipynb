    "\n",
    "Despite revising his own timeline for the virus spread subsiding on US soil, Mr Trump claimed the country is \"getting close\" to \"winning\" what he again called a \"war\" against the COVID-19 disease outbreak.\n",

Without explaining, he said closing things like airports would be too difficult, suggesting the economic hit would be too high.\n",

He also said he would \"love\" to run against the New York governor in a presidential general election.\n",
